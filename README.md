# Netflix EDA Project

Netflix is a popular service that people across the world use for entertainment. In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, we will explore the "Netflix Shows" dataset using data visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Introduction

In this EDA project, we will work with a Netflix dataset that provides valuable information about various shows available on the streaming platform. This dataset consists of 6,234 entries and 12 columns, each offering unique insights into the content Netflix offers. Let's get acquainted with the dataset columns:

## Project Objective

The objective of this EDA is to explore various aspects of the Netflix dataset, uncovering insights, trends, and patterns that can help us better understand the content available on the Netflix platform. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to answer questions and gain valuable insights into the world of Netflix shows.

## Key Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning**: We will start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring that the data is in a usable format for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we will create insightful visualizations and graphs to explore trends in Netflix shows based on various attributes such as type (movie or TV show), release year, country of origin, and more.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**: We will calculate descriptive statistics to summarize key aspects of the dataset, such as the distribution of release years, the most common content ratings, and more.

4. **Genre Analysis**: We will analyze the distribution of shows across different genres and identify the most popular categories on Netflix.

5. **Duration Analysis**: We will explore the duration of shows and movies on Netflix to understand common time formats and trends.

6. **Time Series Analysis**: Investigate trends in the addition of content over time by analyzing the "date_added" column.

7. **Content Ratings**: Examine the distribution of content ratings and their relationship with other attributes.

8. **Director and Cast Analysis**: Explore the involvement of directors and cast members in Netflix shows.

## Conclusion

This EDA project will provide valuable insights into the world of Netflix content. By the end of our analysis, we aim to have a deeper understanding of the types of shows available, the countries they originate from, how the content library has evolved over time, and much more. Let's dive into the data and discover what it has to offer!
